This pen was inspired and created for the FreeCodeCamp.org Front End framework certification project. It is a quote machine that will continuously rotate through all the quote that I have entered thus far. I am working to integrate a famous quotes API, but for now I have created my own library. I hope you enjoy my creation, which was created using ReactJS
